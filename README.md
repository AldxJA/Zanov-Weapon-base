How do i install the weapon base???
 put the files (zanov folder) on GarrysMod/garrysmod/addonds.
 How do i make attachments???
  look at zv_weapon_example. (ak one) there is a simple EOTECH attachment. (i'd highly suggest using Advanced Bonemerge Tool https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3214439967&searchtext=bone)
Some things are broken/bugged.
 DM me in my discord (aldx_ja/Aldx_Ja). i'll probably try to fix it. (ofc if you know lua you can try fixing it yourself)
Alot of comments are placed in weapon example, zv_effects and zv_viewmodel.

known broken stuff will be put in here:
 if you put any base  that isnt zv_base the swep will break (wtf???)
